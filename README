This is a for of the node-memcache project by elbart http://github.com/elbart/node-memcache

This project adds memcache-pool.js, where you can provide a list of memcache servers rather than just a single server. The pool works lazily, only connecting to each server as requests come in.

Lots still to do, in particular, doesn't yet support weighting on servers. And lots of testing needed.
